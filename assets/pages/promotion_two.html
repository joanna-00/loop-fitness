                <p>"Many who go into training don't think LOOP is tough, but it doesn't fit! It is mega mega hard if you
                    give it full throttle.</p>
                <p>The environment in the center is nice and relaxed. It is not a typical fitness environment, which is
                    why I come here in other fitness centers here in Aarhus C."</p>

                <p>"Then I finally found a form of exercise that suited me. Now I cannot do without it. 14 times and
                    I've lost 6 inches around my life. Wonderful! I am in a better mood, have more strength, better
                    fitness, sleep better and have a better attitude. That's good for a lot of things."</p>

                <p>"I have been training in LOOP for almost five years. In the past, I've trained in many different
                    gyms, and LOOP is the only place I've never grown tired of. There is such a great atmosphere, it's
                    easy to get to, and there's never any waiting time at the machines. I get a lot around the country
                    through my work and therefore really appreciate being able to train freely in all LOOP centers."</p>
